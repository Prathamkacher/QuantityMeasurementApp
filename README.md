# Quantity Measurement App
## A Generic, Type-Safe Measurement Engine in Java

### Project Overview
The **Quantity Measurement Application** is a robust Java-based engine designed to handle diverse physical quantities including **Length, Weight, Volume, and Temperature**. The project demonstrates an architectural evolution from basic object comparison to a highly scalable, generic system that adheres to **SOLID principles**, **Interface Segregation**, and the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle.
This project is build on Incremental model & Test Driven Development Model.
The engine supports cross-unit arithmetic, non-linear temperature conversions, and strict category isolation, ensuring that logically incompatible measurements (e.g., adding weight to length) are prevented at both compile-time and runtime.

### Core Use Case Details

#### UC01 - UC02: Basic Equality
Established the foundation of value-based equality. We moved away from primitive comparison to encapsulated objects, ensuring that `1.0 ft` equals another `1.0 ft` object based on value rather than memory reference.

#### UC03 - UC05: Normalization & Scaling
Introduced the **LengthUnit Enum**. By establishing a base unit (Length), the system gained the ability to compare different units.
* **Logic:** `Value * Factor = BaseValue`.
* **Result:** `1 Yard == 3 Feet == 36 Inches`.



#### UC06 - UC09: Arithmetic & Weight Integration
Extended the engine to support mathematical operations. 
* **Addition:** `2 Inches + 5 cm = 3.97 Inches`.
* **Weight Domain:** Integrated Grams, Kilograms, and Tonnes, applying the same normalization logic used for Length.

#### UC10 - UC11: The Power of Generics
Refactored the core into `Quantity<U extends IMeasurable>`. This move eliminated category-specific classes. 
* **Impact:** Adding **Volume** (Litres, Millilitres, Gallons) required zero changes to the core `Quantity` class, proving the system's scalability.



#### UC12 - UC13: Advanced Arithmetic & DRY 2.0
Introduced Subtraction and Division. 
* **Refactor:** Centralized all math into a private `ArithmeticOperation` enum using **Java Lambdas**. 
* **DRY Logic:** Validation (null checks, category checks) is performed once in a helper method, reducing the bug surface by over 60%.

#### UC14: Non-Linearity & Capability Guardrails
The ultimate test of the architecture. Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit) introduced non-linear formulas ($y = mx + c$).
* **ISP Implementation:** Refactored the `IMeasurable` interface to allow Temperature to "opt-out" of arithmetic operations while keeping Length/Weight/Volume "opted-in."

### Key Technical Concepts Applied
* **TDD (Test Driven Development):** Over 100+ JUnit test cases ensuring 100% coverage of edge cases.
* **Interface Segregation (ISP):** Using default methods to handle optional unit capabilities.
* **Functional Programming:** Using `DoubleBinaryOperator` and `Function<Double, Double>` for math dispatching.
* **Bounded Generics:** Ensuring type safety across measurement domains.
* **Normalization:** Reducing all inputs to a "Base Unit" for consistent comparison.
